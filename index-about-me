  <h1> Introduction </h1>
  <p> You could probably describe me as a millennial, dog lover, frequent window shopper, latest popular workout participant, Aziz fan, comma obsessed, sweet toothed foodie (but who isn’t). When I’m not at work managing marketing accounts, I’m wandering NYC with my pup Mack. When I’m not roaming, I’m eating. But if I’m not eating… I’m probably learning to code. </p>
    
  <p> I’m a little over a  year out of school, and I’m still figuring out EXACTLY what I’d like to do, but I love to learn. And coding knowledge is definitely relevant and cool to have! I’m dying to create something on the web, on my own. </p>
  
  <p> Movement  and knowledge is everything to me. I want to keep moving, avoiding complacency at all costs. There’s a world of information out there, and I want to know everything. </p>

  <h1> Where I'm From </h1>
  <p> I was born and raised in the sunny south of California. So you can imagine the culture shock with my move across the U.S. to NYC. I’m still in the city, because I enjoy the pace and the little life I’ve started here. But you better believe I miss the perfect weather, cruises on the highway, chill vibe… oh, and my family. </p>

  <h1> More About Me </h1>
  <h2> What are your favorite hobbies? </h2>
  <p> I’m another one of those people who live to eat. Unfortunately, I can’t cook. So I love to bake - cookies, pies, cakes, you name it. </p>
  <h2> What's your dream job? </h2>
  <p> Definitely a fusion of Cesar Milan and Anthony Bourdain’s jobs. Like if I had a giant farm for dogs, and I got to travel the world to eat and explore…? Hello, dream job. </p>
  <h2> What music have you been listening to lately? </h2>
  <p> Recently, I’ve been going through this flashback 90s phase. If you’re thinking Backstreet Boys, you’d be right. </p>
